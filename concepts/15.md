# Django
Django is a python framework for web development. As a pentester having basic knowledge of it will be good for finding weakness in Django-powered websites.

To start a project run the following
```
django-admin startproject {project_name}
```

The above command will create a `manage.py` file. This will handle all the configurations of the project.

- To run a server use `python3 manage.py runserver`
- To create a superuser use `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- To run the app use `python3 manage.py startapp`
- To migrate any changes use `python3 manage.py migrate`
