# nmap

This is a very important tool for any pentester. It scans a given target and finds out all the details about the machine like open ports, services running, OS version, etc.
**Remember using this on a machine you don't have permissions is illegal, so use it with responsibility**

Syntax: `nmap [OPTIONS] <target>`

```
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 TARGET_IP | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -sC -sV -p$ports TARGET_IP
```
Some important options:
- -sS: SYN scan, this requires sudo previledges. It performs a incomplete three-way handshake so also called *Half-open* or *Stealth* scan. Use this when the target has a firewall/IDS.
- --scripts: This is used to pass scripts along with the scan used for finding vulnerabilities or running exploits, etc.
- --badsum: creates invalid checksum. Used to detect the presence of firewall

Know about the rest using `man nmap`
