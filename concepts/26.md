# Web Requests using Python
To send GET and POST requests to websites using python we will require a module called 'requests'.
Eg of get request using requests module.
```python
import requests

url = ""
req = requests.Session()
response = req.get(url)
```
Similarly for POST request we have to pass the parameter along with url
```python
import requests

url = ""
req = requests.Session()
data = dict(key="value")
response = req.post(url, data=data)
```
To read the response of the requests we have to use `req.headers` or `req.content`
```python
head = req.headers
html = req.content
```
To clean the html we have two methods:
1. Using Regex by using `re` module
2. Using BeautifulSoup

## Regex
Using Regular Expressions we will first define all html tags which starts with `<` and ends with `>`. This will be done by `clean = re.compile('<.*?>')`. Then we will replace all the tags with empty string using `re.sub`.
```python
clean = re.compile('<.*?>')
text = re.sub(clean, '', html)
```

## HTML parser
This is easier method as we everything will be done by the class.
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
text = soup.h3.get_text()
```
