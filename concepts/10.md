# Static binaries

Sometime all the tools we require on a compromised machine is not available. So we can use static binaries of those tool. Static tools dont require to be installed. It can be executed just by `./<file>`.

The problem with static binaries are they are mostly outdated.

Check [this](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) for available static binaries.
