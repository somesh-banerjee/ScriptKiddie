# Websites basics

To understand how the web works, we will use Wireshark a sniffing tool to look at the requests and responds taking place. Start the capture in wireshark and then open browser. Write any url let say google.com in url bar. Now check the captured packets.

You will see at first the current machine is doing DNS search. After getting the IP address of google.com it is performing a *three-way handshake* with that ip.

After that the application data is being sent from remote ip to local ip.
