# OSI Model

The 7 layer OSI model in brief. For detailed explanation check this [video](https://youtu.be/vv4y_uOneC0)

|Layer|Names | Purpose | Data |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|7   | Application  | Works with the application and provide interface for different apps to transmit data  | --  |
|6   | Presentation  | Translating received data to standard format and also performing encryption/compression before sending  | --  |
|5   | Session  |  This layer establishes a session with the remote machine before the transmission | --  |
|4   | Transport | Divides the data based on protocol used (TCP/UDP)  | Segments(TCP)/ Datagrams(UDP)  |
|3   | Network  | Logical addressing of data using IP address  | Packets  |
|2   | Data link | Physical addressing of Transmission using MAC address of devices(routers/other computers/etc) | Frames  |
|1   | Physical | Transmission of data in physical form and conversions like DAC & ADC  |  Bits |

At different level the data is encapsulated with the header of that layer like [this](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image.jpeg)

At layer 2 a trailer is also added which checks for data integrity at receiver ends.

# TCP/IP Model

This model is more realistic than the OSI model.

|TCP/IP|
|:---:|
|Presentation|Application|
|Transport|
|Internet|
|Network interface|

TCP is a connection based protocol. Before the transmission the client and server performs a *three-way handshake* to setup the connection. The client first sends a SYN flag to which server responds with ACK/SYN flag. The client then reponds with ACK and connection is established. SYN stands for synchronise and ACK means acknowledgement.
