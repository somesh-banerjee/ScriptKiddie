# chisel

We can set up a SOCKS forward proxy using chisel by running\
On compromised system:\
```
./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --socks5
```
On Attack machines
```
./chisel client TARGET_IP:LISTEN_PORT PROXY_PORT:socks
```
When pivoting through a network and if we have to use one proxy with another then the easiest option will be to use sshuttle first and then chisel.

To stop the process just run `jobs` and `kill <jobno>`
