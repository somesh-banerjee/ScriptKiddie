Business logic vulnerabilities arises because of improper logic used in the application. It is caused due to any unintended error by the user. To avoid Developer should not assume that user will act accordingly. Some examples are:

1. Only verifying tasks through client side control.
   - Suppose a user added a item to cart in ecommerce site. Now the webapp use client-side control to calculate the cost. A hacker can easily manupulate the requests and change the cost of the items.
2. While asking for OTP, hacker can change the user parameter to get OTP for some other user, and brute-force the OTP of that user.
3. A e-ecommerce website verifying a units to buy is less than 5 by the following code `if $units < 5`. This leads to vulnerabilities as units given as negative will crash the site.
4. A mistake in logic for storing values like using `int` to store and the value needs to be stored exceeds the range of `int`
5.
