# Pivoting

Pivoting means accessing the internal network through a compromised system of that network and performing different tasks like scanning.
There are several tools for performing pivoting but if we want to do it manually it narrows down to two main methods:
- Port forwarding
- Proxying

Port forwarding is connecting to a target port of the target ip from a local port of attacking machine via the compromised machine. This is faster than proxying. But you can only connect to 1 port.

Proxying means creating a proxy connection through the compromised machine and traffic all data through it. It is slower than port forwarding but can access multiple machines.

Depending on network we choose which is better.

The differnt tools available are:
- socat(Unix and Windows)
- chisel(Unix and Windows)
- sshuttle(Unix only)
- plink.exe(Windows only)
